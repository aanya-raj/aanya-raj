# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Aanya — an AI Engineer specializing in LLM systems, NLP, and intelligent automation.

I currently work as a Machine Learning Developer at Dürr Group, where I design and deploy AI-driven tools that automate translation, documentation, search, and internal workflows. My work focuses on building production-grade AI systems using Azure OpenAI, NLP models, and scalable ML pipelines that solve real enterprise problems.

Before moving into full-time AI engineering, I worked as a freelance Data Scientist for 2+ years, delivering 25+ end-to-end projects to global clients with a 4.9★ average rating. This experience helped me build strong foundations in analytics, machine learning, NLP, and production data pipelines.

### 💼 Current Work (AI Engineer – Dürr Group)
- Building AI-powered enterprise tools for translation, documentation, and workflow automation  
- Developing transformer-based NLP solutions for summarization, multilingual processing, and content intelligence  
- Designing MLOps pipelines for model deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management  
- Automating code documentation and internal knowledge workflows using Generative AI  
- Optimizing AI integrations with enterprise platforms like Salesforce using Azure-based tooling  

### 💼 Freelance Background
- Delivered 25+ projects across ML, NLP, analytics, and BI  
- Built data pipelines, dashboards, prediction models, and reporting systems  
- Worked with international clients remotely since 2021  
- Strong record of client satisfaction and repeat collaborations  

### 🧠 Core Strengths
- LLM & NLP system development  
- Data pipelines & ETL architecture  
- End-to-end ML lifecycle (EDA → Training → Deployment → Monitoring)  
- AI-powered automation & workflow optimization  
- Insight generation and decision intelligence  

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Python • SQL • PySpark • Dataiku • Azure AI • NLP • Machine Learning  
Power BI • Tableau • Excel • Google Cloud • AWS  
ETL • Data Visualization • Model Deployment • Generative AI

I enjoy working on complex AI problems, building intelligent systems, and turning messy data into scalable automation. I’m continuously learning and pushing toward more advanced LLM architectures, agentic workflows, and production AI systems.
